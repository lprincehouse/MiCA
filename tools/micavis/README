Dependencies:

libigraph and python-igraph  (http://igraph.sourceforge.net/download.html)

1. Install libigraph FROM SOURCES (checked in to dependencies).  Ubuntu 12.04 packaged version is wrong

aptitude install build-essential libxml2-dev libglpk-dev libgmp3-dev libblas-dev liblapack-dev libarpack2-dev python-dev

in igraph directory:
  ./configure
  sudo make install

2.  Build Python-igraph.  In python igraph directory:
  sudo python setup.py install

  # igraph compiled .so is in /usr/local/lib... tell ubuntu about that
  sudo ldconfig    
  
   (Ubuntu: apt-get install libigraph-dev, but the python extension must be downloaded and built separately.  You will need python-dev package)
