* fix display tree performance by making it dynamic 
  - eliminate major performance bottleneck

* add boolean options to GUI
     show comm graph
     show current view

* add round display to GUI
     show current round value


* clickable nodes
     - identify clicked node
     - display state somewhere [terminal would probably work fine]
