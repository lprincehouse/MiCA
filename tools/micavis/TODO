* log accumulator
     track current values for every node

* log post-processors
    - insert state-change events 
      (or, perhaps, delete all state events that do not change state)


* add boolean options to GUI
     show comm graph
     show current view

* add round display to GUI
     show current round value


* clickable nodes
     - identify clicked node
     - display state somewhere [terminal would probably work fine]
